# Medical Image Segmentation for Tumor Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a medical image segmentation project focused on tumor detection within class-imbalanced datasets. The goal was to enhance segmentation accuracy using the U-Net architecture and addressing class imbalance through various loss functions.

## Project Highlights

  - Develop a medical image segmentation model for class-imbalanced datasets, specifically for tumor detection within medical images.
  - Implemented a U-Net architecture for image segmentation.
  - Experimented with different loss functions, including Dice loss, Cross Entropy, Combo loss, and Focal loss, to tackle class imbalance.
  - Applied data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal and vertical flips, and random brightness contrast, to enhance the dataset.
  - Utilized three different medical image datasets: Brain Tumor Segmentation, Kidney Tumor Segmentation, and Retina Vessel Extraction.
  - Achieved significantly improved segmentation accuracy.
  - Identified Focal loss as the most effective in handling class imbalance.
  - The combination of loss function selection and data augmentation led to more precise tumor identification.
  - Enhanced accuracy is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging.
